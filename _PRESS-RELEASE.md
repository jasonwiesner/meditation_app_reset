Many people feel there's just not enough time in the day to take time to reset themselves - these are the people who are joining our community at the fastest rate. reset allows the busy dad, overworked mom, or the person who just doesn't have enough time for themselves to meditate whenever its convenient for them! The ease of reset helps its users to prioritize their health inside of their busy schedule.

Jason Wiesner, CEO of reset explained, "People understand that they need to take time out to recalibrate, they just don't always know when the perfect opportunity will arise. Having a personal meditation trainer in their pocket is a huge advantage for the members of our community, who need a quick solution to help reset their current state on the fly, decreasing harmful cortisol levels and improving their overall long term health and longevity. Our habits are the foundation upon which our future selves are built. reset can help turn a few quick meditation sessions into a new and healthy habit that can help to transform our lives from the inside out."

reset is simple. Just open the app and start your meditation session! Stop any time you'd like. reset will log your session if you choose, give you key analytics about your meditation sessions and let you know how far along you've come over time! Look out for future updates, which may contain pre-set meditation times and even more meditation help along with upgrades that will help you become a regular practitioner with even more ease and convenience.

Jasmine from California, an early adopter of reset expressed "I just had to tell my friends and family about it! I understand the benefits of meditating regularly and I've always wanted to start, I just never took the initiative myself to make time. Having reset on my phone and knowing it's there helped me to make the leap that I otherwise would have just kept putting off. The encouraging words the app sends me really mirror my past experiences with expensive personal trainers in terms of helping motivate me to stay on track while adopting a new behavior and making sure I follow through."
